Please create more profile data for the application. 
Please, use the current profile structure (you can look at any data-1.json file, like @public/data/movies/en/data-1.json ), start creating more profile for each category and each language (you can create the same profile in all languages) just to validate the process. Ask me how much profiles you should create before start..

Places where you can get the data to create the clues: 
- Wikipedia
- Any Fandom wiki, like https://starwars.fandom.com/
- Any Celebreties Wiki
- https://www.imdb.com/
- https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
- and any other you may know of.

Check existent profiles to not create any duplication. Please give me the list of profiles you will create for each category, so I can approve it before you start.

Do not store more than 20 profiles in each data-x.json file. When a category/locale data-x.json reach 20 profiles, please create a new data-x.json file following the same structure, but with the next index. For example, if you have data-1.json with 20 profiles, please create data-2.json.

Don't forget to update the manifest.json file with the new profiles, if new data-x.json files are created.

Be sure that the JSON files modified/created are valid JSON files.
