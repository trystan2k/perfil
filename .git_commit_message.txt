refactor(types): improve type safety with explicit zod schemas

- Replace catchall z.unknown() with strict mode in profileMetadataSchema
- Add explicit metadata fields: author, tags, description
- Enhance type inference and prevent runtime property injection
- Update documentation for development log naming conventions
- Update workflow documentation with critical approval requirements

Note: Schema duplication between src/types/models.ts and 
src/domain/game/entities/Profile.ts identified and tracked in Task #99
